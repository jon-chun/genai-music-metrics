# AI Music Generation Research Study: Participant Instructions

## Welcome to the Study

You have been selected to participate in this research study because of your expertise in a specific musical genre. Your insights will help advance our understanding of AI music generation and develop effective prompt engineering techniques for creative applications.

## Study Overview

In this research, you will:
1. Use AI text-to-music systems to generate songs in your area of expertise
2. Refine your prompts over 3-5 iterations to improve the output
3. Evaluate each iteration using our HARMONIC scoring rubric
4. Document your prompt engineering strategies and observations

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Preparation Phase (Before Generation)

1. **Select your genre of expertise**
   - Choose a musical genre, style, or tradition in which you have significant knowledge
   - Document your experience level (years of study/practice, formal training, etc.)

2. **Choose your AI platform**
   - Select from approved text-to-music generation services (Suno, Udio, etc.)
   - Familiarize yourself with the platform's basic functionality

3. **Complete the expertise questionnaire**
   - Rate your knowledge of the genre's history, theory, and conventions (1-10)
   - List key artists/works that exemplify the genre
   - Identify 3-5 essential characteristics that define the genre

### Generation Phase (Main Study)

1. **Initial prompt creation**
   - Create your first prompt aiming to generate music in your chosen genre
   - Include basic specifications (genre, mood, tempo, instrumentation)
   - Document this prompt exactly as entered
   - Do not overthink this first prompt - it serves as a baseline

2. **First evaluation**
   - Generate your first music sample
   - Score it using the HARMONIC rubric (see attached scoring document)
   - Take detailed notes on strengths and weaknesses
   - Save both the audio file and your evaluation

3. **Prompt refinement cycle** (repeat 2-4 times)
   - Based on your evaluation, refine your prompt to address weaknesses
   - Document your refinement strategy (what you changed and why)
   - Generate a new music sample
   - Score using the HARMONIC rubric
   - Save both the audio file and your evaluation
   - Continue this process for at least 3 total iterations

### Final Documentation

1. **Complete the summary report**
   - Document all prompts used (verbatim)
   - Include all HARMONIC scores for each iteration
   - Categorize your refinement strategies using the provided classification system
   - Reflect on what prompt strategies worked or didn't work
   - Provide your overall assessment of the AI's capability in your genre

2. **Submit all materials**
   - All audio files generated (labeled by iteration number)
   - Completed HARMONIC rubrics for each iteration
   - Final summary report
   - Original expertise questionnaire

## Evaluation Guidelines

When evaluating using the HARMONIC rubric:

- **Be objective:** Evaluate based on genre standards rather than personal preference
- **Be detailed:** Provide specific musical examples to justify scores
- **Be consistent:** Use the same criteria across all iterations
- **Consider context:** Judge AI output relative to the state of AI music generation, not against professional human composers

## Prompt Refinement Strategies

Consider these approaches when refining your prompts:

1. **Add technical specificity:** Include musical theory elements, structure details
2. **Enhance references:** Add more artist/song references or examples
3. **Elaborate emotionally:** Expand on mood, feeling, or emotional trajectory
4. **Adjust constraints:** Change specific musical parameters (tempo, key, etc.)
5. **Add cultural context:** Include cultural/historical background
6. **Incorporate feedback:** Directly address issues from previous iterations
7. **Restructure information:** Reorganize without changing content
8. **Modify length:** Substantially increase/decrease prompt length

## Timeline and Submission

- Complete all generation iterations within one week
- Submit all materials within three days of completing your final iteration
- Contact the research team if you encounter technical difficulties
