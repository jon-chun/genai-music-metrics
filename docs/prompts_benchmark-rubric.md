# Composite Metric for Evaluating AI-Generated Music: The HARMONIC Framework

After analyzing the background material on creativity evaluation, I've developed a comprehensive metric system for evaluating AI-generated music. This framework integrates general creativity principles with music-specific evaluations to provide a holistic assessment.

## HARMONIC Framework: Holistic Assessment Rubric for Music ONline Intelligence Creativity

The HARMONIC framework evaluates AI-generated music across six major dimensions, each with weighted sub-components. The total score is calculated on a 100-point scale.

### 1. Novelty & Originality (25 points)
*Assesses how the music breaks new ground while maintaining coherence*

- **Unexpectedness** (8 points): Presence of surprising elements that deviate from standard patterns
- **Transformative elements** (7 points): Evidence of ideas that reshape musical expectations or conventions
- **Conceptual distance** (5 points): Difference from training corpus and existing works
- **Structural innovation** (5 points): Novel approaches to musical structure, form, or progression

### 2. Musical Value & Quality (25 points)
*Evaluates fundamental musical aspects*

- **Coherence & structure** (7 points): Logical musical flow and development
- **Technical execution** (6 points): Proper handling of music theory elements
- **Emotional resonance** (6 points): Capacity to evoke emotional responses
- **Memorability** (3 points): Contains distinctive, memorable elements
- **Production quality** (3 points): Technical aspects of sound production if applicable

### 3. Domain-Specific Achievement (15 points)
*Measures success within intended musical context*

- **Genre fidelity** (5 points): Adherence to genre conventions when intended
- **Stylistic consistency** (5 points): Internal consistency of style
- **Instrumental/vocal appropriateness** (5 points): Proper use of instruments or vocal elements within their capabilities

### 4. Computational Creativity Process (15 points)
*Evaluates the AI's creative process itself*

- **Generative approach** (5 points): Level of creativity in the generation method (combinational, exploratory, or transformational)
- **Autonomy level** (5 points): Degree of human intervention required
- **Learning capacity** (3 points): System's ability to improve based on feedback
- **Intentionality** (2 points): Evidence of goal-directed creation

### 5. Human-AI Collaboration Potential (10 points)
*Assesses how well the system works with human creators*

- **Interactivity** (4 points): Responsiveness to human input during creation
- **Controllability** (3 points): Ability to guide output toward desired results
- **Transparency** (3 points): Understandability of the system's decisions

### 6. Cultural & Contextual Impact (10 points)
*Considers broader significance and reception*

- **Audience reception** (4 points): Response from listeners (can be measured through surveys)
- **Expert assessment** (4 points): Evaluation by music professionals
- **Cultural relevance** (2 points): Connection to current cultural contexts

## Implementation Guidelines

### Assessment Methods:
1. **Expert panel evaluation**: A diverse panel of music professionals rates each piece across applicable dimensions
2. **Audience surveys**: Gather feedback from general listeners on emotional impact and reception
3. **Computational analysis**: Quantitative measures for technical aspects like harmonic complexity, rhythmic patterns
4. **Comparative analysis**: Positioning relative to human compositions and other AI systems

### Scoring System:
- Each dimension receives a score based on its sub-components
- Sub-component scores are weighted and summed for dimension totals
- Dimension totals are combined for a final score out of 100
- Both numeric scores and qualitative descriptions are provided

### Proposed Evaluation Process:

1. **Initial technical analysis**: Computational measurement of quantifiable aspects like harmonic structure, rhythmic complexity, and similarity to corpus
2. **Expert evaluation phase**: Panel of experts evaluates the music across all dimensions
3. **Audience testing**: Sample audience provides feedback on emotional response and perceived quality
4. **Context assessment**: Evaluation of the music's potential applications and cultural positioning
5. **Final scoring**: Weighted combination of all evaluation components

## Practical Example Application

To illustrate the framework in action, consider evaluating an AI-generated jazz composition:

1. **Novelty & Originality**: Assess how it introduces unexpected chord progressions while maintaining jazz idioms
2. **Musical Value**: Evaluate harmonic sophistication, rhythmic coherence, and emotional expressiveness
3. **Domain Achievement**: Measure how well it incorporates jazz-specific elements like swing and improvisation
4. **Computational Process**: Consider whether it creates exploratory variations or truly transforms jazz conventions
5. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Test how musicians might interact with or build upon the composition
6. **Cultural Impact**: Evaluate reception by jazz audiences and critics

This HARMONIC framework provides a structured yet flexible approach to evaluating AI-generated music that accounts for both technical quality and creative innovation, while acknowledging the unique aspects of computational creativity in the musical domain.

# PROMPT #3

Great, now slightly modify this scoring rubric to emphasize metrics given this assignment:
1. subject will select a specific genre, style, cultural, etc. of music they are intimately familiar with and can serve as an expert evaluator
2. subject will literately use AI to both generate/refine prompts and use them to generate text-to-music via services like suno, udio, etc
3. at each iteration, students will critically analyze and score each generation (3-5) of refined song
4. analysis of multiple subjects will be compiled to analyze/benchmark the prompt engineering strategies, refinement techniques, steerability/controllability, and ultimate quality of the final song
Given this overall study design, distill both the previous rubric without losing any important detail if possible and provide another new rubric and methodology to compile these individual multi-stage refinements prompts/songs/scorings into some general meta-analysis of prompt engineering strategies, refinement techniques, steerability/controllability, and ultimate quality of the final song worth of a research paper
Finally, provide clear, concise and logical instructions for all subjects on the methodology and scoring rubrics
