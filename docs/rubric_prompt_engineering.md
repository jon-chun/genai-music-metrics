# Meta-Analysis Framework for Prompt Engineering Effectiveness

This framework analyzes patterns across multiple participants and iterations to evaluate prompt engineering strategies.

## A. Prompt Evolution Analysis

| Metric | Measurement Method | Data Collection |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Specificity progression | Track word count, technical term usage, and structural elements across iterations | Document length and keyword density changes |
| Reference inclusion | Track how references to existing works, artists, or techniques affect outcomes | Count and categorize references in prompts |
| Constraint effectiveness | Analyze how musical constraints (tempo, key, structure) affect quality | Document constraint types and corresponding scores |
| Descriptive language impact | Evaluate effectiveness of emotional/sensory language vs. technical terms | Categorize prompt language and correlate with emotional resonance scores |
| Knowledge depth influence | Compare genre expertise level with prompt sophistication and outcome quality | Expert self-rating correlated with technical execution scores |

## B. Improvement Trajectory Analysis

| Metric | Calculation | Interpretation |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Overall quality delta | Average change in total score between first and final iterations | Measures overall refinement effectiveness |
| Component improvement rate | Score change per iteration for each HARMONIC component | Identifies which aspects improve fastest/slowest |
| Diminishing returns threshold | Iteration number where improvement rate drops below 5% | Determines optimal iteration count for efficiency |
| Targeted improvement success | Score improvement in specific areas targeted by prompt refinements | Measures prompt steering precision |
| Refinement strategy effectiveness | Compare average improvement across different refinement approaches | Identifies most effective prompt engineering techniques |

## C. Cross-Genre Comparison Framework

| Analysis Type | Method | Output |
|--------------|--------|--------|
| Genre difficulty assessment | Compare average first iteration scores across genres | Identifies which genres AI handles best/worst initially |
| Genre-specific strategies | Group successful prompt patterns by genre | Produces genre-specific prompt templates |
| Universal vs. genre-specific techniques | Compare effectiveness of similar techniques across genres | Identifies universally effective prompt strategies |
| Technical vs. emotional prompting | Compare effectiveness across genres | Determines if certain genres respond better to technical vs. emotional language |
| Cultural authenticity correlation | Analyze relationship between prompt cultural specificity and authenticity scores | Measures importance of cultural knowledge in prompting |

## D. Prompt Strategy Classification

For meta-analysis purposes, classify each participant's refinement strategies into these categories:

1. **Technical specificity** - Adding musical theory elements, structure details
2. **Reference enhancement** - Including more artist/song references or examples
3. **Emotional elaboration** - Expanding on mood, feeling, or emotional trajectory
4. **Constraint addition/removal** - Changing specific musical parameters
5. **Cultural contextualization** - Adding cultural/historical context
6. **Feedback incorporation** - Directly addressing issues from previous iterations
7. **Prompt restructuring** - Reorganizing information without changing content
8. **Length modification** - Substantially increasing/decreasing prompt length

For each strategy, document:
- Frequency of use across participants
- Average score improvement when applied
- Genres where most/least effective
